**This refined workflow incorporates your feedback and focuses on leveraging ModernBERT's contextual embeddings and cosine similarity for phoneme prediction.

**Refined Workflow:**

**Phase 1: Data Preparation (2 hours)**

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:**
    
    - Load CSV files for each language into Pandas DataFrames.
    - Clean data, handle missing values, and standardize formats.
2. **IPA Phoneme Vectorization:**
    
    - Use `soundvectors` to convert IPA phonemes into numerical vectors.
3. **Contextualization:**
    
    - Create a data structure to store contextual information (language, timestamp, IPA phoneme vector) for each word.

**Phase 2: ModernBERT Embedding (4 hours)**

1. **Load ModernBERT:**
    
    - Load the pre-trained ModernBERT model using Hugging Face Transformers.
2. **Generate English Embeddings:**
    
    - Generate contextual embeddings for all English words in your dataset using ModernBERT.
3. **Project Other Languages:**
    
    - For each non-English word, find its English translation.
    - Retrieve the ModernBERT embedding of the English translation.
    - Store this embedding along with the original word's contextual information (language, timestamp, IPA phoneme vector). This effectively projects the non-English words into the English contextual vector space.

**Phase 3: Cosine Similarity Search and Prediction (4 hours)**

1. **Query with English Word:**
    
    - Generate a ModernBERT embedding for the input English word.
2. **Find Nearest Neighbors:**
    
    - Calculate cosine similarity between the query embedding and all embeddings in your database.
    - Retrieve the nearest neighbors that meet the following criteria:
        - Cosine similarity above a predefined threshold.
        - Include vectors from all languages and timestamps.
3. **Output Contextual Information:**
    
    - Return an array of the timestamp, language, and IPA phoneme vector for each nearest neighbor.
4. **Predict Phoneme:**
    
    - Train a predictive model (e.g., recurrent neural network or transformer) on the retrieved IPA phoneme vectors and timestamps to predict the soundvector over time.

**Phase 4: Evaluation and Refinement (2 hours)**

1. **Evaluate the System:**
    
    - Assess the accuracy of phoneme predictions.
    - Analyze performance across languages and time periods.
2. **Refine the System:**
    
    - Adjust cosine similarity threshold, data cleaning methods, or model parameters to improve performance.

**Tools and Technologies:**

- Same as the previous workflow.

**Timeline Considerations:**

- Same as the previous workflow.

This refined workflow streamlines the process by directly leveraging ModernBERT's contextual embeddings and using cosine similarity for efficient search and prediction. This approach allows you to work within the 1-day time constraint while achieving your project goals.**
